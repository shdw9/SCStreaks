# SCStreaks

SCStreaks is a **WIP** Snapchat Streaks Calculator.

Ever **broke** a streak and need to submit a ticket to support, but you **forgot** what your streak number?

With this tool, you can save the streaks you currently have, and calculate what your streak number is supposed to be.

There are **three features** to SCStreaks:

1. **Save Streaks**: This will allow you to save your current streak log by answering a few questions
2. **Load Streaks**: This will allow you to read the current streak log to make sure that everything has saved.
3. **Calculate Streaks**: This will take the last modified date of the streak log and allows you to calculate the streak number with a given date.

Please do note that this is a **WIP** and updates will happen to improve this program. 

## Installation & Usage

To use SCStreaks, run the SCStreaks.exe (which can be found under the Releases tab) and follow the prompts. It's pretty straightforward.
